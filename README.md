Welcome to the "Pãozinhos da Vovó" project! Here you will find all the details and resources related to the prototype of this innovative autonomous bakery, developed as part of an interdisciplinary project during the fifth semester of the Computer Engineering course.

## Overview

The objective of this project is to develop a prototype of an autonomous bakery - "Pãozinhos da Vovó" - using the concepts of Internet of Things (IoT), [Helix Sandbox](https://github.com/Helix-Platform/Sandbox-NG) and a Web platform capable of offering its customers freedom in the purchase of products, generating greater operational efficiencies, cost savings and a more convenient and streamlined shopping experience for consumers.
